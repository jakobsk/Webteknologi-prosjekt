            <h2>Purpose and goals</h2>  
            <p>This website is the core component of the business model of the firm, as it is an online Sport shop without
                 any physical stores. Its purpose is thus to display all the items that XXXL currently has in its storage 
                 facility. The overall aim of the website is to make revenue for the company. Lastly, the website also serves
                  as a recruitment platform for new employees. XXXL wishes to compete with already established competitors and
                   therefore needs an increasing workforce.  </p>

        <div id = audience> 
            <h2>Audience</h2>
