            <h2>Our client</h2>
            <p>Our client is two sports interested friends that has decided to create their own online webshop for selling sports equipment. Their names are Odin and Are Odin and they are both 30 years old.</p>
        </div>
        <div id = purpose_goals>
            <h2>Purpose, goals and audiance</h2>
            <p>This website is the core component of the business model of the firm, as it is an online Sport shop without
                 any physical stores. Its purpose is thus to display all the items that XXXL currently has in its storage
                 facility. The overall aim of the website is to make revenue for the company. Lastly, the website also serves
                  as a recruitment platform for new employees. XXXL wishes to compete with already established competitors and
                   therefore needs an increasing workforce.  </p>
                   <p>The website will attract people who are interested in sports, travelling and physical activities. Since XXXL aims to have a broad selection of items to offer its customers, the audience will range from the professional athlete to the regular man on the streets who simply likes to exercise.</p>
        </div>
        <div id = navigation>
            <h2>Navigation Structure</h2>
            <p>The navigation structure of our website is a fully connected graph.
              It is possible to access all pages of the website from each other.
              The apperance of navigation bar is independent of the page you're currently at.
              The reason behind this structure is that it should be easy to navigate for the user,
              no option is "hidden" behind a sequence of multiple choices.
              Clicking front page, about,contact us or shopping sends the user directly to the requested page.
              Clicking Categories on the other hand gives the user a roll down menu with the further choices of football, running and tennis.</p>
