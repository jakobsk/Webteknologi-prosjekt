        <div id = adm_details>
            <h2>Administrative details</h2>
            <p>Our client is two sports interested friends that has decided to create their own online webshop for selling sports equipment. Their names are Odin and Are Odin and they are both 30 years old.</p>
        </div>
        <div id = purpose_goals>
            <h2>Purpose, goals and audiance</h2>
            <p>This website is the core component of the business model of the firm, as it is an online Sport shop without
                 any physical stores. Its purpose is thus to display all the items that XXXL currently has in its storage
                 facility. The overall aim of the website is to make revenue for the company. Lastly, the website also serves
                  as a recruitment platform for new employees. XXXL wishes to compete with already established competitors and
                   therefore needs an increasing workforce.  </p>
                   <p>The website will attract people who are interested in sports, travelling and physical activities. Since XXXL aims to have a broad selection of items to offer its customers, the audience will range from the professional athlete to the regular man on the streets who simply likes to exercise.</p>
        </div>
        <div id = navigation>
            <h2>Navigation Structure</h2>
            <p>The navigation structure of our website is a fully connected graph.
              It is possible to access all pages of the website from each other.
              The apperance of navigation bar is independent of the page you're currently at.
              The reason behind this structure is that it should be easy to navigate for the user,
              no option is "hidden" behind a sequence of multiple choices.
              Clicking front page, about,contact us or shopping sends the user directly to the requested page.
              Clicking Categories on the other hand gives the user a roll down menu with the further choices of football, running and tennis.</p>

        <div id = "content">
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <ol>
              <li><span class="title">"Front page - front_page.html"</span>
                The front page is the landing page of the website. It will contain selected offers that will be selected randomly each time a user loads the front page. The random selection will be done with javascript

                <figure><img src="img/front_page.png" alt="Front page"></figure>

              </li>
              <li><span class="title">"About"</span>
                This section will describe the business concept of XXXL and who the persons behind the concept are. It will have a picture of the creators of the webstore and some text about their background. It will also describe why XXXL is the best alternative when shopping sports equipment online.

                <figure><img src="img/about.png" alt="about"></figure>

              </li>
              <li><span class="title">"Categories"</span>
                <ol>
                  <li>"Football"</li>

                  <li>"Tennis"</li>
                </ol>
                This section will give you three alternatives when clicking on it. When clicking one of the three alternatives the user will go to a page that shows pictures of available sports equipment in each category. It will have the price and a brief decscription of each item. When clicking a picture the picture will expand it it will display more information. This will be done using javasrcipt. If a user clicks on "add to cart" the item will be put in the cart. This will also be done with javascript

                <figure><img src="img/Categories.png" alt="categories"></figure>

              </li>

              <li><span class="title">"Contact us"</span>
                This page will contain an e-mail for customer support. 

                <figure><img src="img/contact_us.png" alt="Front page"></figure>

              </li>
              <li><span class="title">"Shopping Cart"</span>
                This will show all the items the user has added to the shopping cart in that session, and the total price of all items in the shopping cart

        <div id = min_requirements>
            <h2>Minimum Requirements</h2>
            <p>The website will contain five javascript-enabled functionailies to create a more dynamic and responsive website. We image the following scripts to work this way: <br>
            <p>Torgeir and Audun will be responsible for the development of this script:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><u>image_script.js.</u> This script is responsible for enlarging a picture if a user clicks on it. Furthermore, there will also be some additional text displayed when this function is invoked. The text will contain a short description of some features of the respective product.  </li>
                <li><u>shopping_cart.js</u> This script will dynamically update the shopping cart with the item the user wants. It will also contain code to remove certain items if demanded.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Øystein and Per will be responsible for the development of this script:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><u>random_offers.js</u> A javascript function that determines which items that are displayed on the front page, as well as which that are on sale at the moment. </li>
                <li><u>autofill_content</u> Will be responsible for creating more html content on a website. That is, we don't want to write all the html code ourself (which would be highly repatative work), but rather let javascript do this for us. We picture us that this function will provide all html pages with content </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Jakob will be responsible for the development of this script:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><u>form_validation</u> In the contact us page, we envision a html form capability such that users could send us their information. If we enable user input, we must ensure input-validation so that the input conforms with the intended format.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id = plan>
            <h2>Plan</h2>
