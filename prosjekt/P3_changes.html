            <h2>Quick overview of distribution of workload:</h2>
            <p>
                Jakob has implemented the navigation bar and written html and javascript for the three categories pages.
                Per has worked on the random-offers function and has composed and implemented the home screen where the random offers are presented. Per's tasks has mainly been
                Torgeir has mainly been working on shopping_cart.html and the functionality bound to this(adding content to shopping cart from the other pages, deleting products from shopping cart through the shopping cart page and written a "database of products" in javascript.js).
                Torgeir has mostly written JavaScript code, but also some HTML
                The whole team has written CSS specific for the page they have been working on, CSS is mostly written in a shared CSS file(main.css), but also some inline CSS in the HTML files where this has been more natural.
            </p>

            <h2>How each of the team members fulfilled their minimum requirements:</h2>
            <p>
              All minimum requirements are met. Through out the development process we made design decisions resulting in e.g form validation solely being done through specifications of the form and input tag since this resulted in the wanted behavior.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id = change_of_workload>
            <h2>Change of workload</h2>
            <p>
              Originally two more people(Audun and Øystein) had signed up to be part of our team. Unfortunatly we were not able to get in touch with them for a meet up.
              When we wrote P2 we had accounted for being a team of five people, but instead we ended up being three people. We had given tasks to Øystein and Audun in hope of getting in touch with them.
              "Their" tasks was therfore shared between the three of us.<br>
              Jakob was responsible of implementing features present on multiple pages, like the navigation bar, even though this was not specified under "workload" in the P2 document.
              It was convenient to build the other pages on this skeleton page which Jakob wrote. The banner design as color scheme was chosen during P1 and has not changed since.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id = changes>
            <h2>Design changes we have made:</h2>
            <p>
              The name of front_page.html is changed to index.html for automatic load when folder in folk.ntnu\torgesla\project is opened.
              In P2 we planned to write a file autofill_content.js, this was suposed to contain functionality for modularity.
              This was mainly going to be used on the three catergories pages which has a similar structure, but contains different products(product objects).
              We decided that it was easier to bug track and unnecessary to use html generative javascript for three html files.<br>
              The exact design and content of each page may have been changed, since the specifications in P2 was written before we got a hands-on experience with coding in html,

            <ol>
              <li><span class="title">"Front page - front_page.html"</span>
                The front page is the landing page of the website. It will contain selected offers that will be selected randomly each time a user loads the front page. The random selection will be done with javascript

              </li>
              <li><span class="title">"About"</span>
                This section will describe the business concept of XXXL and who the persons behind the concept are. It will have a picture of the creators of the webstore and some text about their background. It will also describe why XXXL is the best alternative when shopping sports equipment online.

                </ol>
                This section will give you three alternatives when clicking on it. When clicking one of the three alternatives the user will go to a page that shows pictures of available sports equipment in each category. It will have the price and a brief decscription of each item. When clicking a picture the picture will expand it it will display more information. This will be done using javasrcipt. If a user clicks on "add to cart" the item will be put in the cart. This will also be done with javascript

            <h2>Minimum Requirements</h2>
            <p>The website will contain five javascript-enabled functionailies to create a more dynamic and responsive website. We image the following scripts to work this way: <br>
            <p>Torgeir and Audun will be responsible for the development of this script:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><u>image_script.js.</u> This script is responsible for enlarging a picture if a user clicks on it. Furthermore, there will also be some additional text displayed when this function is invoked. The text will contain a short description of some features of the respective product.  </li>
                <li><u>shopping_cart.js</u> This script will dynamically update the shopping cart with the item the user wants. It will also contain code to remove certain items if demanded.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Øystein and Per will be responsible for the development of this script:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><u>random_offers.js</u> A javascript function that determines which items that are displayed on the front page, as well as which that are on sale at the moment. </li>
                <li><u>autofill_content</u> Will be responsible for creating more html content on a website. That is, we don't want to write all the html code ourself (which would be highly repatative work), but rather let javascript do this for us. We picture us that this function will provide all html pages with content </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Jakob will be responsible for the development of this script:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><u>form_validation</u> In the contact us page, we envision a html form capability such that users could send us their information. If we enable user input, we must ensure input-validation so that the input conforms with the intended format.</li>
              </ul>
