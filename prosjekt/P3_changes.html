            <h2>Quick overview of distribution of workload:</h2>
            <p>
                Jakob has implemented the navigation bar and written html and javascript for the three categories pages.
                Per has worked on the random-offers function and has composed and implemented the home screen where the random offers are presented. Per's tasks has mainly been
                Torgeir has mainly been working on shopping_cart.html and the functionality bound to this(adding content to shopping cart from the other pages, deleting products from shopping cart through the shopping cart page and written a "database of products" in javascript.js).
                Torgeir has mostly written JavaScript code, but also some HTML
                The whole team has written CSS specific for the page they have been working on, CSS is mostly written in a shared CSS file(main.css), but also some inline CSS in the HTML files where this has been more natural.
            </p>
            <h2>How each of the team members fulfilled their minimum requirements:</h2>
            <p>
              All minimum requirements are met. Through out the development process we made design decisions resulting in e.g form validation solely being done through specifications of the form and input tag since this resulted in the wanted behavior.

            <h2>Change of workload</h2>
            <p>
              Originally two more people(Audun and Øystein) had signed up to be part of our team. Unfortunatly we were not able to get in touch with them for a meet up.
              When we wrote P2 we had accounted for being a team of five people, but instead we ended up being three people. We had given tasks to Øystein and Audun in hope of getting in touch with them.
              "Their" tasks was therfore shared between the three of us.<br>
              Jakob was responsible of implementing features present on multiple pages, like the navigation bar, even though this was not specified under "workload" in the P2 document.
              It was convenient to build the other pages on this skeleton page which Jakob wrote. The banner design as color scheme was chosen during P1 and has not changed since.

            <h2>Design changes we have made:</h2>
            <p>
              The name of front_page.html is changed to index.html for automatic load when folder in folk.ntnu\torgesla\project is opened.
              In P2 we planned to write a file autofill_content.js, this was suposed to contain functionality for modularity.
              This was mainly going to be used on the three catergories pages which has a similar structure, but contains different products(product objects).
              We decided that it was easier to bug track and unnecessary to use html generative javascript for three html files.<br>
              The exact design and content of each page may have been changed, since the specifications in P2 was written before we got a hands-on experience with coding a larger project in HTML and Javascript.
